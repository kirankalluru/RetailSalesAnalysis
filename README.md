## üìå Project Overview  
This project demonstrates **SQL skills and techniques** used by data analysts to explore, clean, and analyze retail sales data.  

The project covers:  
- ‚úÖ Database setup  
- ‚úÖ Data cleaning  
- ‚úÖ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- ‚úÖ Business-driven SQL queries  
- ‚úÖ Insights & findings  

**Database**: `p1_retail_db`  
**Level**: Beginner  

---

## üéØ Objectives  
1. **Set up the retail sales database** and populate it with data.  
2. **Clean the dataset** by removing missing or null records.  
3. Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**.  
4. Answer **business questions using SQL**.  

---

## üóÇÔ∏è Project Structure  

### 1. Database Setup  
```sql
CREATE DATABASE p1_retail_db;

CREATE TABLE retail_sales (
    transactions_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    sale_date DATE,
    sale_time TIME,
    customer_id INT,
    gender VARCHAR(10),
    age INT,
    category VARCHAR(35),
    quantity INT,
    price_per_unit FLOAT,
    cogs FLOAT,
    total_sale FLOAT
);
````

### 2. Data Exploration & Cleaning

* **Record Count**
* **Unique Customers**
* **Unique Categories**
* **Null Value Checks & Deletion**

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM retail_sales;
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) FROM retail_sales;
SELECT DISTINCT category FROM retail_sales;

DELETE FROM retail_sales
WHERE sale_date IS NULL OR sale_time IS NULL OR customer_id IS NULL
   OR gender IS NULL OR age IS NULL OR category IS NULL
   OR quantity IS NULL OR price_per_unit IS NULL OR cogs IS NULL;
```

---

### 3. Business Queries

1. **Sales on a specific date (2022-11-05):**

```sql
SELECT * FROM retail_sales
WHERE sale_date = '2022-11-05';
```

2. **Transactions where category = 'Clothing' and quantity ‚â• 4 in Nov-2022:**

```sql
SELECT *
FROM retail_sales
WHERE category = 'Clothing'
  AND TO_CHAR(sale_date, 'YYYY-MM') = '2022-11'
  AND quantity >= 4;
```

3. **Total sales per category:**

```sql
SELECT category, SUM(total_sale) AS net_sale, COUNT(*) AS total_orders
FROM retail_sales
GROUP BY category;
```

4. **Average age of customers buying from 'Beauty' category:**

```sql
SELECT ROUND(AVG(age), 2) AS avg_age
FROM retail_sales
WHERE category = 'Beauty';
```

5. **Transactions where total\_sale > 1000:**

```sql
SELECT * FROM retail_sales
WHERE total_sale > 1000;
```

6. **Number of transactions by gender and category:**

```sql
SELECT category, gender, COUNT(*) AS total_trans
FROM retail_sales
GROUP BY category, gender
ORDER BY category;
```

7. **Best selling month (based on average sale) in each year:**

```sql
SELECT year, month, avg_sale
FROM (
    SELECT EXTRACT(YEAR FROM sale_date) AS year,
           EXTRACT(MONTH FROM sale_date) AS month,
           AVG(total_sale) AS avg_sale,
           RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY EXTRACT(YEAR FROM sale_date)
                       ORDER BY AVG(total_sale) DESC) AS rank
    FROM retail_sales
    GROUP BY 1, 2
) t
WHERE rank = 1;
```

8. **Top 5 customers by total sales:**

```sql
SELECT customer_id, SUM(total_sale) AS total_sales
FROM retail_sales
GROUP BY customer_id
ORDER BY total_sales DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

9. **Unique customers per category:**

```sql
SELECT category, COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS cnt_unique_cs
FROM retail_sales
GROUP BY category;
```

10. **Orders by shift (Morning, Afternoon, Evening):**

```sql
WITH hourly_sale AS (
    SELECT *,
           CASE
               WHEN EXTRACT(HOUR FROM sale_time) < 12 THEN 'Morning'
               WHEN EXTRACT(HOUR FROM sale_time) BETWEEN 12 AND 17 THEN 'Afternoon'
               ELSE 'Evening'
           END AS shift
    FROM retail_sales
)
SELECT shift, COUNT(*) AS total_orders
FROM hourly_sale
GROUP BY shift;
```

* Several **high-value transactions (>1000)** exist, showing premium purchases.
* **Monthly sales trends** reveal seasonal peaks.
* **Top customers** identified by total spend.
* Sales vary across **shifts (Morning, Afternoon, Evening)**.
